# ðŸ“Š **Modeling Phase in CRISP-DM**

### Overview
Following the **Data Understanding** and **Data Preparation** phases, we now move on to the **Modeling** phase of the CRISP-DM process. The focus of this stage is to determine the most suitable model architecture for our dataset and evaluate its performance. As a reminder, the data exploration and preparation steps are crucial and form the foundation for successful modeling.

### Key Questions to Address:
- **What kind of model architecture best fits our data?**
- **How well does the model perform technically?**
- **Can we improve its performance?**
- **How do we evaluate the model's performance?**

### Supervised Learning for Classification and Regression
In this exercise, we will apply **supervised learning**, which is a subfield of machine learning used for **classification** and **regression** tasks. This approach allows us to use labeled data to train models that can predict outcomes or categorize data points.

### Data Preprocessing
- The data we are working with has already been cleaned, but some **pre-processing steps** may still be required to ensure that the data is in the right format for modeling.
- **No major exploration or preparation** of the data will take place in this exercise, but always remember that these steps are essential in future data analysis tasks.

### Why This Stage is Important
- **Model Selection**: Choosing the right model architecture is crucial for getting the best performance out of your data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: It's important to evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and identify areas for improvement.

In this exercise, we will explore how to apply supervised learning techniques to our dataset and assess how well our model performs, making adjustments as necessary.
